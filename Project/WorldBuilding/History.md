In the distant future, the world falls to over-pollution and the tectonic plates collapse to give way to rising sea levels. The land falls under the sea-level, hills become islands, rivers become underwater ravines, cities become ocean floor. This event is called the [[Tidal Crest]]This leads to the formation of newer and more isolated growth of technology.  It also reveals long existing species of humanoids that were hidden in the waters.

Humanity quickly develops newer hydro-based power generation systems that they utilize to develop supplements (as seen in [[General World - Building]]). 

Humanity loses around 30%~ of it's population during the [[Tidal Crest]]. This massive loss leaves them scrambling to rebuild and mourn the life they left behind. 

Underwater cities are now named after rivers (Yamuna, Brahmaputra, etc.) and hills become islands. Islands are generally considered to be dangerous and full of the limited wild-life that survives the Tidal Crest.
