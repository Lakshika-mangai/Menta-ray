Large cities resemble a mixture of art deco architecture mixed with steampunk elements. 

Main city (Thungabhadra) is located in a semi-shallow warm water ocean. Common animals found in warm water oceans are sea anemones, clownfish, eels, sharks, coral, humpback whales, tetras, angelfish, catfish and hawksbill sea turtles. These dictate the architectural motifs of the region. Popular motifs include jellyfish, sharks, seals, turtles and angelfish. Things that are found in cold-water climates like seals are often mechanical built to assist humans and other species to integrate with society. Other natural elements that commonly inspire the motifs are crustaceans, moons, nautilus. 

It is filled with a population split of 40% Human and 50% Merman, along with around 10% diverse or mixed species. 

Humans live in large, domed structures as they need oxygen to breathe. Merman are freely able to swim between domed structures and open sea. Communication in the open sea is largely based on ISL as sound does not travel underwater. Mermans have a short range echolocation.
